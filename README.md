# humidity_and_carbon_monoxide_temperature_meter


This device allows you to measure carbon monoxide as well as room temperature and humidity. This allows the person to control these parameters. The device provides remote control which takes place via SMS messages. While at work or on vacation, sending an SMS with the word "OFF" to the phone number of the device you will receive readings of temperature, humidity and carbon monoxide.
